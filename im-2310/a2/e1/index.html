    /* I picked Akira as my reference image to use for my wireframe and for that I picked this specific colour palette as it represents Akira. 
    In the movie these colours are shown alot as it evoke a feeling of a futuristic world. By using dark and bright & neon colours to contrast with each other. 
    From this color I have chosen, I do feel like it reminded me of Akira alot as it is one of the iconic anime movies ever. */
